              True success, the kind that builds companies, changes lives, and feeds the soul never happens by accident.

            <p>
              It is the result of thousands of hours of practice and an uncountable number of tiny failures that (when properly leveraged) create the learning that makes success possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small failures (often referred to as "practice") are the <em>sine qua non</em> of success...you can't have success without failure.

              But why are some people effected so negatively by failure?
            </p>
            <p>
              What's the difference between those who use their failures to build success and those who become depressed, stymied, and ultimately give up on their goals?
            </p>
            <p>
              What does it mean to be "failproof"?  What allows certain people to use their failures produvtively to accelerate growth.

              <em>The Failure Project</em> examines the qualities that make people "failproof" so that these skills can be intentionally developed and learned.

            <p>
              By learning to leverage the small, productive failures, you can increase productivity, heighten goal achievement, and prevent the occurrance of catastrophic or unrecoverable failures from ever occurring.
